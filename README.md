### Data Analysis + Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks
Repository for list of data analysis and machine learning jupyter notebooks from courses that I attended (or am attending), and additional work done for the dataset beyond what was required. 

This will also include datasets I found interesting from other sites. 

### supermarket.ipynb
This `.ipynb` (and `.ppt` not included here) was done in fulfillment of BCG RISE 2.0 Part-time Business & Data Analytics Capstone Project. Client data has been anonymized fully for the data visualization. 

Thus, results from this set of analysis might not make sense. But the concepts of analysis and story-telling used here were done similarly to what we did for the client. There are some variations on the presentation style and data presented to account for the fact that the project was a team effort but this presentation with the NTUC FairPrice data was an individual one.

### sms.ipynb
This `.ipynb` is a personal project to explore NLP N-gram and word embedding using the SMS Corpus available on Kaggle. Dataset link included in the notebook. There is an accompanying `.ppt` available unpon request.
